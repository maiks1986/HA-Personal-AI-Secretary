# AFTER REBOOT INSTRUCTIONS

1. Rename the folder on your desktop to:
   HA-Personal-AI-Secretary

2. Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD) inside that folder.

3. Run this command to update your GitHub link:
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/maiks1986/HA-Personal-AI-Secretary.git

4. Verify it worked by running:
   git remote -v

Everything in the code (README, manifest, scripts) has already been updated to match this new name.
